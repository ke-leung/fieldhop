somewhere in a lavender field, 
in the brig of a viking ship, 
on the rooftop of a skyscraper, 
on top of a grassy hill, 
on a log floating down the river, 
inside a tree stump, 
along a street of brownstones, 
in a highschool gymnasium, 
somewhere under a waterfall, 
in the belly of the beast, 
in a primary coloured submarine, 
whenever you turn around, 
under those old gargoyles, 
along the country roads, 
on the outskirts of the neon city, 
in the middle of the crowd, 
under the ivy-covered bridge, 
in the firefly field, 
in the cathedral lofts, 
in that overgrown train station, 
in a garden full of bees, 
along the subway lines, 
in the light of the stained glass windows, 
on the steps of the castle, 
on top of the flag tower, 
next to the neighbourhood green box, 
on the magic school bus, 
under the train tracks, 
in the cherry blossom tree, 
in the attic,
