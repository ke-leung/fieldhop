laughs in your face, and
snorts while laughing, and
sets something on fire, and
uncovers a revenge plot, and
breaks gravity, and
makes an origami crane, and
hits the target, and
has their first kiss, and
writes your favourite bible verse, and
paints the lady in the painting, and 
dishes it out with the girls, and
reads your favourite book, and

meets an immoveable object, and
meets an unstoppable force, and 
has a movie night, and

watches the rain from the window, and 
shivers from the cold, and 
curls up by the fire, and 
burns their marshmallows, and 
listens to say so, and
