why don't we bake a cherry cheesecake? 
you're ugly crying, have a tissue. 
you lie down and let go. 
we're floating in the creek. 
her skin is shimmering red. 
someone must have dropped their groceries. 
i think i'm coming down with the flu. 
everything feels a little nostalgic. 
the glass shards cover the ground like frost. 
the sand whirls around you like saturn's rings. 
we get home late for dinner. 
we move on to the next house. 
you're on the cusp of something huge. 
taking a walk sounds nice right now. 
you should take a breath of fresh air. 
the dust will soon settle. 
you can hear someone playing guitar softly. 
they took up knitting afterwards. 
let's take the scenic route. 
here comes that old feeling. 
you can really feel the yearning. 
the moon is watching. 
painting sounds like a good idea. 
the quiet is delicate, don't break it. 
you can always ask for a change. 
they contain multitudes. 
they just had to leap. 
he giggles, again. 
she kept it together. 
laying on the kitchen floor sounds nice. 
you should listen to your favourite song. 
you continued to be yourself. 
let me know if you need anything from the store. 
stay safe and take care. 
take care of yourself and your loved ones. 
then tea was made.
why don't we try pottery?
remember to wash your hands. 
remember to floss. 
remember to eat healthy. 
remember to find love everywhere.
i found a song you'd like.
